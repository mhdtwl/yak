• Contrary to humans, a standard Yak year consists of 100 days.

• Each day a LabYak produces 50-D*0.03 liters of milk (D = age in days).

• At most every 8+D*0.01 days you can again shave a LabYak (D = age in
days).

• A yak can be first shaven when he is 1 year.

• A LabYak dies the day he turns 10



The moment you open up the webshop will be day 0, and all yaks are
eligible to be shaven, as the two of you spent quite a lot of time setting
up this shop and the shepherd wasn’t able to attend much to his herd.

• Each morning the shepherd milks and shaves his yaks. Yaks which aren’t
eligible to be shaven on the exact day, cannot be shaved today. Example:
a yak who started out on day 0 as 4 years, can be shaven again during
day 13.

• When querying your app and placing orders, the elapsed time in days (T)
is used. A value of for instance 13 means that day 12 has elapsed and
we’re at midnight day 13.
